# Hadoop-Installer
Hadoop Installer using Java.  

 A simple java program for installing the hadoop software in any linux based system using gui mode. Currently if we use the command
 line interface to install hadoop software then it will takes so much time. Also you need to remember various commands and thier
 numberings i.e. which command is to be executed after other.
